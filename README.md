# Send Data via PHP
This code can be used as a template to save data as a JSON at the end of a web experiment (such as muchanical turk).

If you assign each subject a unique ID (see [counter](http://github.com/steveharoz/counter)), the ID can be shown at the end to pay subjects.

Thanks to [Mike Bostock](https://github.com/mbostock) for help understanding javascript fetch.
